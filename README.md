# About_Me
A little more information about me and what I'm all about!


I'm an apriring developer currently living in PDX. Ever since graduating in August of 2016 with a B.A. in English and a minor in Biology, I have turned my focus to learning programming. I began my journey with front-end development in HTML and CSS. I recall how absurdly exciting my first expoure to HTML was when my best friend took it upon herself to educate me: "You made a word appear on the page...AND you made it turn PURPLE!" was my wide-eyed, awestruck response. A picture of my dog soon "magically" appeared under the PURPLE! word, and I was hooked.

I spent the rest of that year devouring codedacademy.com and codeschool.com tutorials on front-end development, and began the Local Roasting Co website project, which you can view here on my GitHub. It is still a work in progress, but I'm proud of the what I've done and excited to continue my work and complete the site. 

During this front-end project, I also began studying Python. My very first experience with python definitely felt less awesome, and more awful. However, six months later I can now say that I love Python, and I've begun to appreciate the incredible power and potential it offers. It is this experience that resulted in my decision to return to school, with the hope of pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. I intend to focus on data science and machine learning, and I am currently attending classes at Portland State University to complete my undergraduate prerequisites. 

I have a passion for learning and problem-solving and am excited about the creative potential that working in development offers. As an English major my favorite aspect of writing was the sense that I was putting a puzzle together piece-by-piece, and I have found that same enjoyment designing functions and building programs.
